## 🧠 About

This CLI calculator project, written in **Python**, offers:

- 🧮 **Standard arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- 🧪 **Scientific functions**: `log`, `exp`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `sqrt`, etc.
- 💱 **Base conversions**: binary ↔ octal ↔ decimal ↔ hexadecimal
- ⚖️ **BMI calculator**: Input height and weight to compute Body Mass Index
- 🖥️ **GUI mode using Tkinter** for a user-friendly interactive interface
- 💻 **CLI mode** for terminal-based usage

It’s ideal for practicing math, health utilities, and small educational projects.
